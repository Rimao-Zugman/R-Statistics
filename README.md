# R-Statistics
Notebooks on R and statistics

Thanks for reading this section.
Attached you will find my studies and advances in the knowledge of R.
Most of the exercises are based on the lectures of the course: "R and Statistics" of HarvardX, whichis part of the Data Analysis for life sciences.
The main file is called "Project Alpha", while the rest of the files are related to the different chapters and exercises of the course.
It is separated in four sections, the syllabus is: 
1) Week1 = Introduction to exploratory Data Analysis, dplyr, Histograms, qq-plots, boxplots.
2) Week2 = Random Variables and probability distributions + Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
3) Week3 = Inference I: P-values, Confidence Intervals and Power Calculations
4) Week4 = Exploratory Data Analysis. Scatterplot, Symmetry of Log Ratios
There are some Notes in Spanish my native language, with time I will translate them to english.
